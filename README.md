ðŸ”— Description:

This project simulates a simplified Browser History Manager using a Doubly Linked List (DLL) data structure in C++. It allows users to:

ðŸ—¬ Visit new websites

ðŸ”™ Navigate back by a number of steps

ðŸ”œ Navigate forward by a number of steps

The project demonstrates real-world usage of linked lists and memory management to mimic the way modern browsers manage navigation history.



Key Features:

visit(url) â€“ Add a new webpage to the history, discarding forward history if present.

back(steps) â€“ Move back a certain number of steps in history.

forward(steps) â€“ Move forward a certain number of steps.

Command-line interface (CLI) for interactive navigation.
